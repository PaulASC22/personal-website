                learning how to create a website at All Star Code!
                I am always interested in learning new things and I like to go on vacations around the world!

                <p class="hobby_text">I enjoy gaming during my free time and I mainly play Minecraft and occasionally other games. It helps
                    me to ease my mind anytime I am stressed
                    with schoolwork or other things.

                <p class="hobby_text">I have always enjoyed biking around my neighborhood since there is a long road very close to my house
                    that is extremely easy to traverse and has no hills. I usually
                    ride my bike with my parents and we often bike to restaurants and eat there.

                <p class="hobby_text">I got into this during the pandemic via Tik Tok and I started watching Naruto which I liked so I
                    decided to get Crunchyroll and spent many hours on there. I was also able to learn
                    how much better Bleach is than Naruto through it.
